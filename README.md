# CoffeeOS

A x64 UEFI enabled operating system project being built while drinking lots of coffee.

## Tasks

Below is a list of tasks that I have layed out for myself for the project.

- Setup Inital Project


### What got me into the idea of trying write an operating system

Well about a year ago now, I had to go on full disability because of some medical issues. I had nothing to do through out my day except for loafing around and being depressed that I no longer had anything to do with my day or in my case *night*. I was a care giver for about 15 years.

Plus as a hobby programmer for the past 20 plus years I have always wanted to learn what it takes to run a computer and hardware. I've taken many programming classes over the years but none that involved working directly interfacing with hardware.

This operating system is currently not being planned on running on real hardware but an emulator though through out building it, I will be testing some functionality on it. One major reason is that I no longer have a PS/2 mouse and keyboard and everyone in the operating system circle tells me it is very taunting task to write a USB driver so at this point, I am not planning on implemeting one.

To check out my work you will need some kind of emulator installed that can run x86_64 architecture and has UEFI enabled.
